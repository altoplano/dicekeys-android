`DiceKeysApiClient(callingContext: `[`Context`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html)`)`

The API client used to ask the DiceKeys app to generate cryptographic keys seeded by a user's
DiceKey and to perform operations on the application's behalf.

**IMPORTANT**

**To use this API, you must:**

1. Call [create](create.md) to instantiate an API for your activity or fragment, which you can use
to make API calls/
2. Implement *onActivityResult* for your activity or fragment, and pass the
intent you receive to your API object's [handleOnActivityResult](handle-on-activity-result.md) function. This allows the
API to receive responses to API requests, process them, and return them to you.

If you forget the second step, your API calls will never returnâ€”a class of bug first
documented in ([Steiner and Hawes, 1949](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.T.A._(song))).
